# React.js Demo
The purpose of this [project](http://www.xhsun.me/react-demo/), for me, is to learn how to build a web page using [React](https://reactjs.org/)

#### Things You May Want To Know
- The whole thing will run for about 1 minute and 50 seconds
- For the most part, this demo runs fine on mobile device. But do know that some text/animation might not display properly. Thus I highly suggest you run this on a desktop.
